# V2 Immutability Attestation (No Further Mutations)

Attested at (UTC): 2025-12-28T07:13:32Z

I attest that **KT_TEMPLE_V2** is frozen as a Gold Master baseline under:

- `KT_PROD_CLEANROOM/04_PROD_TEMPLE_V2/`

From this point forward, no mutations are permitted without:

1) explicit new authorization  
2) new verification proving all invariants remain PASS  
3) a new freeze manifest and seal  

This attestation is constitutional and fail-closed: any untracked change invalidates the Gold Master.

Freeze artifacts (authoritative pointers):

- `KT_PROD_CLEANROOM/04_PROD_TEMPLE_V2/docs/V2_FULL_RELEASE_MANIFEST.jsonl` (full-tree fingerprint; self-excluding)
