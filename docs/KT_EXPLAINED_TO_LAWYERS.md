# King's Theorem (KT) — Explained to Lawyers

## Plain-English description

King's Theorem (KT) is a governed reasoning and measurement architecture consisting of (A) a sealed runtime "kernel" that executes requests through a strict contract and governance receipts, and (B) an offline "growth layer" that runs deterministic crucibles and epochs, evaluates outcomes, compiles lossy curriculum packages, stores training exemplars under strict controls, and runs distillation pipelines. The system is designed to be auditable, deterministic, and fail-closed: it measures intelligence without silently influencing the kernel.

## What makes KT different (value proposition)

- Measurement without influence: tooling executes the kernel as a black box and records only bounded, schema-validated receipts and hashes.
- Governed learning pipeline: learning is offline only, re-entering runtime only via signed curriculum packages and strict ingestion rules.
- Determinism + provenance: execution-path proofs, append-only ledgers/manifests, strict schema perimeters, and constitutional guards prove system behavior rather than asserting it.

## What we want legally

- Maintain source availability for research but block commercial exploitation, especially training/distillation using KT outputs.
- Preserve attribution and prevent commercial cloning via redistribution/hosting restrictions and invariant-tamper termination.
- Prepare for either (a) commercial licensing (royalty-bearing) or (b) assignment (sale) while retaining name credit.

## Protectability (realistic)

- Copyright: protects expression/code/docs.
- Patents: should target the method, e.g., deterministic governance receipts + sealed kernel boundary + offline curriculum compilation + evaluation ledger/delta chaining + controlled training warehouse + distillation under constraints.
- Trade secrets: only for non-published implementation details; once public, secrecy is lost.

## Immediate asks for counsel

- Quick patentability scan and filing strategy (provisional first).
- Confirm license enforceability language and tighten to reduce loopholes.
- Draft a standard commercial license + negotiation terms (royalty schedule, audit rights, attribution, restrictions on training).
