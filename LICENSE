KING'S THEOREM RESTRICTED RESEARCH LICENSE v1.1
Copyright (c) 2025 Robert King. All rights reserved.

1. Definitions

"Software" means this repository and all associated source code, documentation, specifications, schemas, build scripts, and any included assets.

"Outputs" means any data, logs, artifacts, metrics, reports, curricula, datasets, manifests, ledgers, distilled artifacts, or other results generated by running the Software, in whole or part, including modified versions.

"Commercial Benefit" means any direct or indirect commercial advantage, revenue, cost reduction, competitive benchmarking, product improvement, or operational gain for any for-profit entity or for any activity intended to support commercial operations.

2. Limited Grant (Non-Commercial Research Only)

Permission is granted to view, study, and run the Software solely for non-commercial research, educational, and personal evaluation purposes, provided that all conditions in this License are satisfied.

3. Core Prohibitions (Non-Negotiable)

You may not, without an explicit separate written license from the copyright holder:

Commercial Use / Benefit: Use the Software for any activity involving Commercial Benefit, including internal evaluation, benchmarking, or research by or for a commercial entity.

Model Training / Distillation: Use the Software or any Outputs to train, fine-tune, distill, evaluate, or improve any machine learning model or reasoning system intended for commercial use or commercial advantage.

No SaaS / Hosting: Host, deploy, or make the Software available as a service to third parties (including "free" services that indirectly monetize).

No Redistribution: Redistribute, publish, sublicense, or provide the Software (modified or unmodified) to any third party.

No Commercial Derivatives / Bundling: Incorporate, bundle, or use the Software to develop any system, product, or service intended for commercial advantage, including "inspired by" or "functionally equivalent" replacements built using the Software as a reference.

No Dataset/Curriculum Generation for Commercial Systems: Use the Software or Outputs to generate datasets, curricula, evaluation artifacts, benchmark suites, or training materials for any commercial system.

4. Derivative Works (If Allowed by Separate Permission)

If the copyright holder grants separate written permission to create derivative works for research purposes, then:

All derivatives must remain subject to this License (or substantially similar non-commercial restrictions) unless explicitly re-licensed in writing by the copyright holder.

Derivatives must be clearly marked as modified and must preserve provenance.

5. Governance / Invariants Integrity (Termination Trigger)

The Software contains constitutional invariants and governance/receipt mechanisms intended to enforce safety, auditability, and determinism boundaries. Any attempt to remove, bypass, materially weaken, or conceal these constraints—including removal of required audits, guards, ledgers, manifests, schema validation, determinism proofs, or execution-path evidence—constitutes a material breach and results in immediate termination of all rights granted under this License.

6. Termination

Any breach of this License automatically terminates all permissions immediately and without notice. Upon termination, you must cease use and destroy any copies of the Software in your possession or control. Termination does not limit the copyright holder's right to pursue remedies.

7. Ownership

The Software is licensed, not sold. All right, title, and interest remain with the copyright holder.

8. Governing Law

This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising under or related to this License shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Missouri, and by using the Software you consent to that venue and jurisdiction.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

10. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
